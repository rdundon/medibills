I'd like to stub a Node / Express API/UI monorepo project that can run locally, but support user authentication and network requests in case I waant a hosted solution later.

The project must:
 - Use TypeScript
 - Use Express for the API (in `./api`)
   - Use Sequelize for the database and data models, using sqllite locally as the default
   - support .env file settings
   - Use the following data models. Below is the description, but all data models should have a userid so users can only access their stuff:
     - MedicalBills
       - MedicalProvider (One to One)
       - Date of Service
       - MedicalBillCharges (One to One)
       - MedicalServiceEvents (One to Many)
       - Total
     - ExplanationOfBenefits
       - Date of Service
       - MedicalProvider (One to One)
       - Total Paid
       - Total Billed
       - Total Discount
       - Total May Owe
       - Insurer (String for now)
       - MedicalServiceEvents (One to Many)
     - Users
       - Username
       - Password
       - Email
     - MedicalProviders
       - Name
       - Address
       - Phone
       - Website
       - PaymentWebsite
     - CollectionBills
       - Date of Notice
       - MedicalProvider
       - Date of Service
       - Amount Total
     - MedicalServiceEvents
       - Date of Service
       - Medical Provider (One to One)
   - API should have unit tests, using Jest or something better
  - UI (in `./ui`) will use Vue, and Playwright or Cypress for testing
